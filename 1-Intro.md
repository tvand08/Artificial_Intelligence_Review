# Intro review
### What is AI?
- Artificial Intelligence is the study of computations that make it possible to
perceive, reason, act rationally, behave, learn
- Emphasis on: Perception, reasoning, action
   - Human like behavior

### Goals of AI
  - Engineering: solve real world problems
  - Scientific: use computers as a platform for studying Intelligence itself

### Advantages of implementing theories of intelligence on a computer?
   1. Problem solving <---> computation
   2. Computers force precision
   3. computational measurements
   4. computers as guinea pigs

### Measure of AI success
- is the task clearly defined?
- is there an implementation?
- does the application solve a real problem?

### AI view Categories

|Systems that think like humans|Systems that think rationally|
| --- | --- |
|**Systems that act like humans**| **systems that act rationally**|

### Acting rationally: rational agent
- rational behavior: doing the right thing
   - the right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information

### Rational Decisions
- **Rational**: maximally achieving pre-defined Goals
  - being rational means maximizing your expected utility

### Rational agent
- an agent is an entity that perceives and acts
- __this course is about designing rational agents__
- For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the agent (or class of agents) with the best performance

### Other definitions in AI
- AI is the design of flexible programs that respond productively in situations that were not specifically anticipated by the designer
