# Intro review
### What is AI?
- Artificial Intelligence is the study of computations that make it possible to
perceive, reason, act rationally, behave, learn
- Emphasis on: Perception, reasoning, action
   - Human like behavior

### Goals of AI
  - Engineering: solve real world problems
  - Scientific: use computers as a platform for studying Intelligence itself

### Advantages of implementing theories of intelligence on a computer?
   1. Problem solving <---> computation
   2. Computers force precision
   3. computational measurements
   4. computers as guinea pigs

### Measure of AI success
- is the task clearly defined?
- is there an implementation?
- does the application solve a real problem?
